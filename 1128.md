# 11.28.17 - C, the ultimate hipster, using # decades before it was cool.

### \#
Used to provide preprocessor instructions.  
These directives are handled by gcc first.

**`#include <LIBRARY> | "<LIBRARY>"`**
- link libraries to your code
- when you use `include`, the compiler finds the file and replaces include with what is inside (i.e. replace the include with all of the headers inside a header file)

**`#define <NAME> <VALUE>`**
- replace all occurences of NAME with VALUE
- `#define TRUE 1`

For example, for the pipe assignment you could put the following in a header file and include it in the actual file:
```c
#define READ 0
#define WRITE 1
```

**macros:**
- `#define SQUARE(x) x * x`  
- SQUARE(x) is the NAME, x * x is the VALUE
...  
`int y = SQUARE(9);` ==> `int y = 9 * 9;`

- `#define MINE(x,y) x < y ? x : y`

**conditional statement:**
Useful when using header files and there are multiple functions with the same name.
```c
#ifndef <IDENTIFIER> //if not defined
#define <IDENTIFIER>
<CODE>
#endif
```
If the identifier has been defined, ignore all the code up until the endif statement. 

For example:
```c
#ifndef PARSE_H // parse.h would break
#define PARSE_H
int count_tokens ...
...
#endif
```
