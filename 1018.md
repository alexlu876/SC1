# 10.18.17 - Back to the Grind

### valgrind
- tool for debugging memory issues in C programs
- You must compile with -g in order to use valgrind (and similar tools)
Usage:
```
gcc -g foo.c
valgrind --leak-check=yes ./a.out
```
This may create a separate debugging file (depending on your OS), which you should probably avoid adding to github.
