# 11.14.17 - Wait for it
```c
int f -2;
f = fork();
if(f){
    sleep(1);
}
fork();
printf("post-fork I'm %d\tf: %d\tparent: %d\n", getpid(), f, getppid());
```
**orphan processes:** If a parent process has ended, `getppid()` returns 1.

While a child process is a normal executeable process with its own memory space, a thread is code that runs on its own but shares its memory with another process (only running as long as the parent is running). 

### wait - `<unistd.h>`
Stops a parent process from running until any child has provided status information to the parent via a signal.  
Usually the child has exited.

Returns the pid of the child that exited, or -1 (errno).

`wait(int *status)`
- the parameter (status) is used to store information about how the process exited
