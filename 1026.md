# 10.26.17 - Read your writes!

### umask - `<sys/stat.h>`
- Set the file creation permission mask
- By default, created files are not given the exact permissions provided in the mode argument to open. Some permissions are automatically shut off.
Umask is applied in the following way:
`new_permissions = ~mask & mode`
The default mask is 0002.

mode   = 666 -> 110 110 110  
umask  = 022 -> 000 010 010  

~umask =     -> 111 101 101  
& mode =     -> 110 110 110  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
       = 644 -> 110 100 100

**`umask(<MASK>)`**
- You can define the umask using a 3 digit octal.
- `umask(0000);` allows everything

### read - `<unistd.h>`
- read in data from a file
- `read(<FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <BUFFER>, <AMOUNT>)`; read AMOUNT bytes from file
- `read(fd, buff, n)`
- Read n bytes from the fd's file and put that data into buff
- Returns the number of bytes actually read. Returns -1 and sets errno if unsuccessful.
- BUFFER must be a pointer

### write - `<unistd.h>`
- write data to a file
- `write(<FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <BUFFER>, <AMOUNT>)`
- `write(fd, buff, n)`
- Write n byes from buff into fd's file
