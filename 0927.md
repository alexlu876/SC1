# 9.27.17 - Ctrings

**Strings** - character arrays (a string of characters...)
- There is no string data type; only char.

By convention, strings end with a null character (either '', 0, or '\0'; NOT '0' because it has a value).
When you make a literal string using "", an immutable string is created in memory. There strings are automatically null terminated.

All references to the same literal string refer to the same immutable string in memory.

YOU CANNOT MODIFY LITERAL STRINGS.

### DECLARING STRINGS
`char s[256];`
- normal array declaration
- allocates 256 bytes
`char s[256] = "imagine";`
- allocates 256 bytes
- creates the immutable string `"imagine"` and then copies it (including the terminating null) into the array
`char s[] = "tuesday";`
- allocates 8 bytes
- creates the immutable string `"tuesday"` and then copies it (including the terminating null) into the array
`char *s3 = "mankind";`
- creates the immutable string `"mankind"` and returns a pointer to that string
- Since the pointer is to an immutable piece of memory, you cannot modify strings created this way.
