## Monday, 10/30 Seek and ye shall find by Ida Wang

**Intersting tech news**:

### lseek - `<unistd.h>`  
- set the current position in an open file
- returns the number of bytes the current position is from the beginning of the file, or -1 (errno).

**`lseek(<FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <OFFSET>, <WHENCE>)`**  
- OFFSET: The number of bytes to move the position by (can be negative)
- WHENCE: where to measure the offset from
    - `SEEK_SET`: offset is evaluated from the beginning of the file
    - `SEEK_CUR`: offset is relative to the current position in the file
    - `SEEK_END`: offset is evaluated from the end of the file

Application in our last assignment (dev-random): instead of closing the file and reopening to move from write to read, use lseek to set the position to the beginning of the file again.

### stat - `<sys/stat.h>`
- get information about a file (metadata)
- **`stat(<PATH>, <STAT BUFFER>)`**
- does not require a file descriptor (you can stat a file without opening it)
```c
struct stat sb;
stat("foo", &sb);
```
**STAT BUFFER**
- Must be a pointer to a struct stat
- All the file information gets put into the stat buffer.

Some of the fields in struct stat:
- `st_size`: file size in bytes
- `st_uid, st_gid`: user ID, group ID
- `st_mode`: file permissions
- `st_atime, st_mtime`: last access, last modification
