`srand(time(NULL))` returns the number of seconds since 1.1.1970

### ARRAYS AND POINTERS
Array variables are immutable pointers. Pointers can be assigned to array variables (aka, arrays are immutable, pointers are not).
```c
int ray[5];
int *rp = ray;
```
`ray[3]` is the same thing as `*(ray+3)`
```
ray[3] = *(ray+3);
3[ray] = *(3+ray);
```
Bracket notation simply means to add the two and de-reference (but DO NOT do the second option because that is dumb).

Formally put:
`a[i]` notation is shorthand for `*(a+i)`

`p++` means return p, then add 1
`++p` means add 1, then return p

### WRITING FUNCTIONS
Function headers: `<return type> <name> (<parameters>)`
All functions are pass by value. Function arguments are new variables that contain a copy of the data passed to them.
```c
doubla a = 2.3;
    foo(a);
...
void foo(double x){
    x = 59;
}
```
When calling foo, a new variable will be created (i.e. x for a), so when modifying the variable the original will not be changed.
If you want to actually modify the variable within the function, use pointers.
```c
void foo(double *x){
    *x = 59;
}
```
When passing an array, you pass only the pointer.
