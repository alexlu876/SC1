# 11.27.17 - Redirection; how does it... SQUIRREL

### File Redirection
- Changing the usual input/output behavior of a program.

### Command line redirection:
- **`>`** redirects stdout to a file (creates a new file if the file doesn't exist)
    - overwrites the contents of the file
    - `<COMMAND> > <FILE>` i.e. `ls > file_list`
- **`>>`** redirects stdout to a file by appending
- **`2>`** redirects stderr to a file
    - overwrites the file (2>> appends)
- **`&>`** redirect stdout and stderr (&>> appends)
- **`<`** redirects stdin from a file
    - the file goes into the command
- **`|` (pipe)** redirect stdout from one command to stdin of the next
    - `ls | wc`

`$ ps > ps_file` writes whatever ps gives into a file; a good way to write logs  
`$ cat` with no file name opens stdin, and prints it to stdout  

`$ cat > new_file` the worlds simplest, and most useless text editor
- control-d to send the end of file character, and close

`$ cat new_file > newer_file` takes new_file and send it to newer_file

| # | std |  
| --- | --- |  
| 0 | stdin |  
| 1 | stdout |  
| 2 | stderr |

### Redirection in c programs
**dup - `<unistd.h>`**  
- duplicates an existing entry in the file table
- returns a new file descriptor for the duplicate entry
- `dup(fd)` returns the new file descriptor

**dup2 - `<unistd.h>`**
- `dup2(fd1, fd2)` redirects fd2 to fd1
- duplicates the behavior for fd1 at fd2
- you will lose any reference to the original fd2; that file wll be closed

`dup2(3, 1)` this gets rid of stdout  

| # | std |  
| --- | --- |  
| 0 | stdin |  
| 1 | foo.txt |  
| 2 | stderr |  
| 3 | foo.txt |   
| 4 | bar.txt |  

```c
int x = dup(1); // makes 5
dup2(3, 1) // modifies 1 to foo.txt
```
| # | std |  
| --- | --- |  
| 0 | stdin |  
| 1 | foo.txt |  
| 2 | stderr |  
| 3 | foo.txt |  
| 4 | bar.txt |  
| 5 | stdout |  

`dup2(x, 1)` puts stdout back into 1
