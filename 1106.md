# 11.6.17 - Are your processes running? Then you should go out and catch them!

### fgets - `<stdio.h>`
Read in from a file stream and store it in a string.  
`fgets(<DESTINATION>, <BYTES>, <FILE POINTER>)`  
`fgets(s, n, f)` reads at most `n-1` characters from file stream `f` and stores it in `s`  

#### File pointer
- File * type, more complex than a file descriptor
- stdin is a FILE * variable; can be used with fgets

Stops at newline, end of file, or the byte limit.  
If applicable, keeps the newline character as part of the string, appends NULL after.  
`fgets(s, 256, stdin)` reads a line of text from standard in

```c 
printf("enter data: ");
fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);

printf("s: %s", s);
```

### sscanf - `<stdio.h>`  
Scan a string and extract values based on a format string.  
`sscanf(<SOURCE STRING>, <FORMAT STRING>, <VAR 1>, <VAR 2>...)`  

## Processes
Every running program is a process. A process can create subprocesses, but these are no different from regular processes.  
A processor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core).  
"Multitasking" appears to happen because the processor switches between all the active processes quickly.  

### pid 
Every process has a unique identifier call the pid.  
pid 1 is the init process (if you shut down pid 1, you shut down your computer).  
Each entry in the /proc directory is a current pid.
`ps` shows all the processes running that YOU own and are attached to terminal session.  
`ps -a` shows everything? 
`ps -ax` processes that are not attached to a terminal session - actually shows everything
