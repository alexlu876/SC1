### Socket
A connection between 2 programs over a *network*.  
A socket corresponds to an IP (internet protocol) Address / Port pair.

#### To use a socket
1. create the socket (kind of like creating the WKP)
2. bind it to an address and port
3. listen (creator) / initiate a connection (client)
4. send / receive data

### IP Addresses
*All* devices connected to the internet have an IP address.  
IP addresses come in 2 flavors, IPv4 (the main standard) and IPv6 (what should be the main standard).  
Addresses are allocated in blocks to make routing easier.

**IPv4:** 2 byte addresses of the form `[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]`  
- Each group is called an *octet*.  
- At most there are 2^32, or ~4.3 billion IPv4 addresses.

**IPv6:** 16 byte addresses of the form: `[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]:[0-ffff]`  
- Each group is known as a *hextet* (although not as standard as the octet).  
- Leading 0s are ignored.  

Any number of consecutive all 0 hextets can be replaced with `::`

For example:  
`0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 004f : 13c2 : 0009 : a2d2`  
can also be written as  
`:: 4f : 13c2 : 9 : a2d2`
