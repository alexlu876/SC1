```c
void print_bytes(void *p, int size){
    int i = 0;
    unsigned char *cp = (unsigned char *)p;
    for(; i < size; i++){
        printf("byte %u: %d\n", i, *cp);
        cp++;
    }
}
int main(){
    int x = 302;
    print_bytes(&x, sizeof(x));
}
```
generally we think of ints as a single place in memory that stores an int, but ints actually have 4 bytes, so if you declare `int x = 32`, that sets x to [ 0 | 0 | 0 | 32 ]

actually, Mr. DW lied, and that is not always the case. 
- i.e. 302 is [ 46 | 1 | 0 | 0 ]  
- or at least that's how it works on his computer 

**endian-ness** of a number:
- big-endian - most significant digits first
- little-endian - least significant digits first

46 | 1 | 0 | 0
--- | --- | --- | ---
00101110 | 00000001 | 00000000 | 00000000

**`WEXITSTATUS(status)`** a macro where things are replaced; hence the CAPs
- looks at the bytes of status
- returns the process has returned when it exited

### wait - `<unistd.h>`
- waits for a specific child  
`waitpid(pid, status, options)` 
- **pid:** the pid of the specific child to look for; if -1, will wait for any child
- **options:** can set other behavior for wait; if 0, will work normally
