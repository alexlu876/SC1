```c
void print_bytes(void *p, int size){
    int i = 0;
    unsigned char *cp = (unsigned char *)p;
    for(; i < size; i++){
        printf("byte %u: %d\n", i, *cp);
        cp++;
    }
}
int main(){
    int x = 302;
    print_bytes(&x, sizeof(x));
}
```
generally we think of ints as a single place in memory that stores an int, but ints actually have 4 bytes, so if you declare `int x = 32`, that sets x to [0|0|0|32]

actually, Mr. DW lied and 302 is [46|1|0|0]  
or at least that's how it works on his computer 

**endian-ness** of a number:
- big-endian
- little-endian
