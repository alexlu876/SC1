# 11.9.17 - Time to make an executive decision
**Do Now:** `execlp` --> `int execlp(char *file, char *arg, .../*. (char *) NULL */)`

## the exec family - `<unistd.h>`
There are a number of c functions that can be used to run other programs from within.  
Replaces the current process with the new program.

### `execlp(char *file, char *arg0, ..., (char *)NULL)`
- file should be the same as arg[0], so you basically put in the command twice
- since there can be an arbitrary number of arguments you must end with NULL
- i.e. `execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);`

### `execvp`
- an easier version of execlp so you don't have to individually put in each arg; instead you just pass an array of strings
```c
char *args[5];
args[0] = "ls";
args[1] = "-a";
args[2] = NULL;

execvp(args[0], args);
```
- **YOU MUST REMEMBER TO PUT A NULL AT THE END OF THE ARGS WITHIN THE ARRAY**
