# 12.1.17 - Sharing is caring!
**Do Now:** Writing a c program with a variable, fork, adjust the value in the child, and print it out in both parent and child.
```c
int f;
double var = 5.83;
f = fork();
if(!f){
    var *= 10;
    printf("[child]: %d\n", var);
}
else{
    int status;
    wait(&status);
    printf("[parent]: %d\n", var);
}
```
Parent | Child
--- | ---
5.83 | 58.3

## Shared Memory - `<sys/shm.h>`, `<sys/ipc.h>`, `<sys/types.h>`
- a segment of heap memory that can be accessed by multiple processes
- shared memory is accessed via a key that is known by any process that needs to access it
- does not get released when a program exits (only when rebooting)

### 5 Shared Memory Operations:
1. Create the segment (happens only *once*)
2. Access the segment (happens once per process)
3. Attach the segment to a variable (once per process)
4. Detach the segment from a variable (once per process)
5. Remove the segment (only once)

### 1: `shmget`
Create or access a shared memory segment.  
Returns a shared memory descriptor (similar in concept to a file descriptor), or -1 if it fails (errno).

`shmget(key, size, flags)`
- **key:** unique integer identifier for the shared memory segment (like a file name)
- **size:** how much memory to request
- **flags:** includes permissions (same as for files, 3-digit octals) for the segment, combined with bitwise or
    - `IPC_CREAT` create the segment; if segment is new, will set value to all 0s
    - `IPC_EXCL` fail if the segment already exists and `IPC_CREAT` is on
    
### 2: `shmat`
Attach a shared memory segment to a variable.  
Returns a pointer to the segment, or -1 (errno).

`shmat(descriptor, address, flags)`
- **descriptor:** return value of `shmget`
- **address:** if 0, the OS will provide the appropriate address
- **flags:** usually 0, but one useful one
    - `SHM_RDONLY` makes the memory read only

Modifying the Do Now:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define KEY 24601

int main () {
    int f;
    int sd = shmget(KEY, sizeof(double), 0600 | IPC_CREAT);

    f = fork();
    if (!f) {
        double *p = shmat(sd, 0, 0);
        *p = 198746.9;
        printf("[child]: %d\n", *p);
    }
    else {
        int status;
        
        double *p;
        *p = shmat(sd, 0, 0);
        
        wait(&status);
        printf("[parent]: %d\n", *p);
    }
}
```
