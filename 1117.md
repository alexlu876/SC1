# 11.17.17 - Ceci n'est pas une pipe

### pipe  
- a conduit between 2 separate processes on the same computer
- pipes have 2 ends; a read from end and a write to end
- unidirectional (a single pipe must be either read or write only in a process); they only go one way
- act just like files; open, close, read, write - same functions are used, and they go into the file table as well
- you can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write
- unnamed pipes have no external identifier (woah!!!) 

### pipe - `<unistd.h>`
- create an unnamed pipe
- returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not
- opens both ends of the pipe as files (will show in the file table)

`pipe(int descriptors[2])`  
- descriptors: array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe

```c
int main(){
    int fds[2];
    pipe(fds); // creates a pipe
    
    int f;
    f = fork(); // now both parent and child have an array
    
    // if child
    if(!f){
        close(fds[READ]); // for child to write to the parent 
        char s[10] = "hello!";
        sleep(2); // parent will wait for the child to run, even without using wait
        write(fds[WRITE], s, sizeof(s));
    }
    //if parent
    else{
        close(fds[WRITE]);
        char s[10];
        read(fds[READ], s, sizeof(s)); // read will block until there is something to read in the pipe
        printf("parent received: [%s]\n", s);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
