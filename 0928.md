# 9.28.17 - A string of functions.

Array variable pointers are IMMUTABLE. You can modify the array itself, but not what the pointer is pointing to.

You can only assign char arrays with `=` at declaration.
- `char s[] = "zero";` --> ok
- `s = "seven";`       --> not ok; s is an array pointer, and cannot be modified

Char pointers can be assigned using `=` at any time.
- `char *s = "zero";`  --> ok
- `s = "seven";`       --> ok

What a variable is initially created as (regular variable vs. array pointer) is important to keep in mind. Use arrays when you want to be able to modify a string.
