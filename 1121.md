# 11.21.17 - A pipe by any other name...

### named pipes 
- also known as FIFOS (first-in, first-out)
- same as unnamed pipes except FIFOs have a name that can be used to identify them via different programs
- Like unnamed pipes, FIFOs are unidirectional

### `mkfifo`
- shell command to make a FIFO
- `$ mkfifo <pipe name>`

Pipes show up as 0 bytes (`ls -l`) because they do not take up any disk space (only memory).

You can write into the same pipe from different processes, which may lead to conflicts. the pipe will not close until all connected processes have closed.  
If you read a pipe from two different processes, weird things happen (you may get alternating messages); this does not return an error and both processes will just continue running, so **don't do it**.  
If you delete a pipe while it's in use, it will still be in use (it becomes an unnamed pipe)


### mkfifo - `<sys/types.h> <sys/state.h>`
- `mkfifo(<name>, <permissions>)`
- c function to create a FIFO
- reutrns 0 on success and -1 on failure
- once created, the FIFO acts like a regular file, and we can use open, read, write and close on it
- FIFOs will block on open (not read) until both ends of the pipe have a connection

### other things - the 2nd marking period project???
- putting together a shell
- you can put multiple commands on the same line in bash with a semicolon
- i.e. `$ echo HELLO ; ls`
- 2 commands you can't run by exec --> `cd` and `exit`

main  
|  
|----> exec  
|  
v  
continues running
