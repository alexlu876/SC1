# 10.10.17 - If you don't pay attention you'll get into a heap of trouble!

### struct
We use the `.` operator to access a value inside a struct.
```c
struct foo {
       int a;
       char x;
       
       struct bar { double z; short pants; }
       struct foo *next;
};
foo s;
s.a = 10;
s.x = '@';
```
`struct` can include structs within, as well as struct pointers.
This is basically a node, which allows us to make things like linked lists!!!

You can make pointers to functions. If you put one inside a struct, it looks a lot like a method.

`.` binds before `*`
```c
struct foo *p;
p = &s;
(*p).x;
```
`*p.x` is the same thing as `*(p.x)`;

To access data from a struct pointer you can also use `->`.
`p->x` is the same thing as `(*p).x`

You can typedef structs, but be careful because this will hide the fact that you are working with a struct.

## Stack v. Heap Memory

Computer programs seaprate memory usage into two parts: stack and heap.

Eaver program can have its own stack and heap.

### Stack Memory
- Stores all normally declared variables (including pointers and structs), arrays and function calls.
- Function are pushed onto the stack in the order they are called, and popped off when completed.
- When a function is popped off the stack, the stack memory associated with it is released.

# 10.11.17 - Yesterday continued.

```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

struct node *insert_front(struct node *front, int d){
    struct node new;

    new.data = d;
    new.next = front;

    return &new; // see note below
}

int main(){
    struct node *list = NULL;
    list = insert_front(list, 12);
    return 0;
}
```
* This will not work because the node is created within a function, and will "disappear" from memory once the function gets popped off the stack.

### Heap Memory
- Stores dynaminally allocated memory.
- **Data will remain in the heap until it is released** (or the program terminates).
- Can be accessed through pointers.
- Can be accessed across many functions.
