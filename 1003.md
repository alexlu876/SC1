#MAKE IT SO

###SEPARATE COMPILATION
You can combine multiple c files into a c program by including them all in one gcc command.
* **i.e.** gcc test.c string.c foo.c woohoo.c
This creates a single executeable.

You cannot have duplicate function or global variable names acrosss these files. This will result in an error (not a warning). 
* **i.e.** multiple main functions

There must be a main function in order to create an executeable program.

Including .h files: #include "<filename>"

`gcc -c` compiles a c file into a .o file. It is not a fully functional program, but it is compiled code.
Do this to compile a .c file that does not contain a main() function (to check for syntax errors).
.o files can be linked together with .c files through gcc
* **i.e.** gcc string.o main.o
    
###Make
* Creates compiling instructions and sets up dependencies
* Standard name for the file is makefile
Syntax:
```
<TARGET>: <DEPENDENCIES>
TAB<RULES>
```
For example:
```
strtest: dwstring.o main.o
    gcc -o strtest dwstring.o main.o
dwstring.o: dwstring.c dwstring.h
    gcc -c dwstring.c
main.o: main.c dwstring.h
    gcc -c main.c
```
To run the makefile: `make`

Every time you run make, only the target is checked, and any of its subsequent dependencies. 
`touch` makes it seem like the file has been modified

####More common things in make files
```
clean:
    rm *.o
    rm *~
run: all
    ./strtest
```
In this case, `make run` will compile everything, and then run the program.
