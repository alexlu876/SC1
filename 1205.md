# 12.5.17 - How do we flag down a resource?
**Do Now:** How would you control access to a shared resource like a file, pipe, or shared memory, such that you could ensure no read/write conflicts occurred?  

### semaphores
(created by Edsger Dijkstra)  

IPC construct used to control access to a shared resource (like a file or shared memory).  
Most commonly, a semaphore is used as a counter representing how many processes can access a resource at a given time.
- If a semaphore has a value of 3, then it can have 3 active "users".  
- If a semaphore has a value of 0, then it is unavailable.

Most semaphore operations are "atomic", meaning they will not be split up into multiple processor instructions.

## semaphore operations

### non-atomic  
- create a semaphore
- set an initial value
- remove a semaphore

### atomic
`Up(S)` / `V(S)`
- release the semaphore to signal you are done with its associated resource
- psuedocode: `s++`

`Down(S)` / `P(S)`
- attempt to take the semaphore 
- if the semaphore is 0, wait for it to be available
- psuedocode: `while(S == 0) {block} S--;`

## semaphores in C
`<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ipc.h>`, `<sys/sem.h>`

### `semget`
Create/get access to a semaphore.  
This is not the same as `Up(S)` or `Down(S)`; it does not modify the semaphore.  
Returns a semaphore descriptor or -1 (errno).

`semget (<KEY>, <AMOUNT>, <FLAGS>)`
- **KEY:** unique semaphore identifier (use `ftok`)
- **AMOUNT:** amount of semaphores (stored as sets of one or more)
- **FLAGS:** uincludes permissions for the semaphore (like shared memory)
  - `IPC_CREAT` create the semaphore and set value to 0
  - `IPC_EXCL` fail if the semaphore already exists and `IPC_CREAT` is on
