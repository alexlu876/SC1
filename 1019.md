# 10.19.17 - Get Dem Bugs

Valgrind - memory issues

## GDB - GNU Debugger
- more general, like an all-purpose debugger
- an interactive shell to run your program through
```
gcc -c broken.c
gdb ./a.out

(gdb) run

// this shows the line in which the error occured, plus some buffer space
(gdb) list

// you can set break points
(gdb) break <line number>
(gdb) break <function name>

// print variable values and arrays
(gdb) print <variable>
(gdb) print <array>

// continue to next break point
(gdb) continue

// to end session
(gdb) quit
```

### Commands from the gdb shell
- run: runs the program until it ends / crashes
- list: show the lines of code run around a crash
- print <VAR>: print a variable
- backtrace: show th current stack
- break <line number>: creates a breakpoint at the given line

Running a program in pieces:
- continue: run the program until the next breakpoint
- next: run the next line of the program only
- step: run the next line of the program; if that is a function call, run the next line of that function
