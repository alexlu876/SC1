# 11.13.17 - What the fork?
Some things about HW: don't be stupid and read the instructions :(  

## **Managing Sub-Processes**

### fork() - `<unistd.h>`  
Creates a separate process based on the current one.  
The new process is called a child, the original is the parent.

The child process is a duplicate of the parent process.  
All parts of the parent process are copied, including stack and heap memory, and the file table.

Returns 0 to the child and the child's pid to the parent or -1 (errno).

```c
printf("pre-fork\n");
printf("pid: %d\n", getpid());

fork();

printf("post-fork\n");
printf("pid: %d\n", getpid());
```
This prints post-fork twice, because the child process will copy the parent process at the point of the fork, thus running the same code.

There is no guarantee to the order of the processes after forking.

_**DO NOT USE FORK BOMBS:**_  
```
while(1){
    fork();
}
```
