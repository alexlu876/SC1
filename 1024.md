# 10.24.17 - File this under useful information

### file permissions
- 3 types: read, write, execute
Permissions can be represented as 3-digit binary or 1-digit octal numbers.
- 100 <==> 4 => read only
- 111 <==> 7 => read, write, execute

There are 3 permission "areas":
- user, group, others (everyone else)
- each area can have its own permissions
- 0644 => user: read + write, group: read:, other: read

Command: `ls -l` to show file permissions (plus some extra stuff)
- `user-group-other` --> i.e. `-rwxr-xr-x`
To change file permissions: `chmod`
- i.e. `chmod -x <filename>`, `chmod 644 <filename>` (rw-r-r), `chmod 600 <filename>` (-rw-------)
- 644 is probably the standard permissions given by the system

### File table
- A list of all the files being used by a program while it is running.
- Contains basic information like the file's location and size.
- The file table has a limited size, which is a power of 2 (commonly 256). `getdtablesize()` will return this value. This is a hard limit (256 files opened at the same time is a little much).
- Each file is given an integer index, starting at 0. This is referred to as the file descriptor.

There are 3 files always open in the table:
- 0 or STDIN_FILENO: stdin
- 1 or STDOUT_FILENO: stdout
- 2 or STDERR_FILENO: stderr
