# 12.4.17 - Memes
**Do Now:** Why is the aim Memes?  
*They are like memory shared between people.*

Generally, `shmat` after the fork so that pid numbers don't get wonky.

Onto continuing shared memory operations!!

### 4: `shmdt` (shared memory detach)
Detach a variable from a shared memory segment.  
Returns 0 upon success or -1 upon failure.

`shmdt (pointer)`
- **pointer:** the address used to access the segment (will NOT be changed)  

### 5: `shmctl` (shared memory control)
Perform operations on the shared memory segment.  
Each shared memory segment has metadata that can be stored in a struct (`struct shmid_ds`).  
Some of that data stored: last access, size, pid of creator, pid of last modification. 

`shmctl (descriptor, command, buffer)`
- **descriptor:** return value of `shmget`
- **commands:** 
  - `IPC_RMID` removes a shared memory segment
  - `IPC_STAT` opulate the **buffer** (`struct shmid_ds *`) with segment metadata
  - `IPC_SET` set some of the segment metadata from **buffer**
  
### `ipcs` (ipc stat)
Terminal command hat lists the current shared memory segments.
