# 11.1.17 - Where do compsci priests keep their files? In directory!

### Directories
- A *nix directory is a file containing the names of the files within the directory along with basic information, like file type.
- Moving files into/out of a directory means changing the directory file, not actually moving any data (with the exception of drives; i.e. a flash drive).
- All linux box directories are the same size.

### opendir - `<dirent.h>`
- Open a directory file (so that you can read it later).
- This will not change the current working diretory (cwd), it only allows your program to read the contents of the directory file.
- `opendir(<PATH>)`
- Returns a pointer to a directory **stream** (DIR *).
- You cannot create or write to a directory with opendir, only read.

### closedir - `<dirent.h>`
- closes the directory stream and frees the pointer associated with it.
- `closedir(<DIRECTORY STREAM *>)`

### readdir - `<dirent.h>`
- `readdir(<DIRECTORY STREAM *>)`
- returns a pointer to the next entry in a directory stream, or NULL if all entries have already been returned.

#### struct dirent - `<sys/types.h>`
- directory struct that contains the information stored in a directory file.
Some of the data members:
- `d_name`: file name
- `d_type`: file type as an int

For example:
```c
DIR * d;
d = opendir("somedir");

struct dirent *entry;
entry = readdir(d);

closedir(d);
```
You do not have to worry about malloc and free (this is done with opendir and closedir).
File names are limited to 256 characters.
