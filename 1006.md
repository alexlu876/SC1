# 10.6.17 - Finding your type.

### typedef
Allows you to provide a new name for an existing data type.
`typedef <real type> <new name>;`
```c
typedef unsigned long size_t;
size_t x = 139; //x is really an unsigned long
```
**IMPORTANT** - The use of typedef is another in a long line of religious wars in programming (see emacs v. vim, tabs v. spaces, etc.)

### struct
Creates a new type that is a collection of values.
`struct { int a; char x; } s;` makes `s` a variable of that type (that being `struct {int a; char x;}`)
- this makes the size of `s` 8 (theoretically it would be a 5 byte size)

`struct foo { int a; char x; };`
Here, foo is a prototype for this kind of struct, to be used later: `struct foo s;`
```c
struct foo{
       int a;
       char x;
};
```
