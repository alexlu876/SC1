# 11.8.17 - Sending mixed signals

##### Self Explanatory functions
`getpid()` returns the PID of the current process number  
`sleep(<TIME>)` does this need to be explained??

### Signals
Limited way of sending information to a process.

`kill`: command line utility to send a signal to a process
- `$ kill <PID>` sends signal 15 (SIGTERM) to PID; a misnomer - does not always lead to a program quitting
- `$ kill -<SIGNAL> <PID>` sends SIGNAL to PID

`killall [-<SIGNAL>] <PROCESS>`
- sends SIGTERM (or SIGNAL if provided) to all processes with PROCESS as the name

basically; `kill` is for PID, `killall` is for name

### Signal handling in c programs `<signal.h>`

**kill**  
- `kill(<PID>, <SIGNAL>)` 
- returns 0 on succes or -1 (errno) on failure

**signalhandler**  
- to intercept signals in a c program you must create a signal handling function
- some signals (i.e. SIGKILL) cannot be caught
- `static void sighandler(int signo)`
- must be static, must be void, must take a single int parameter
- static: the function can only be called from within the file it is defined

**signal**
- after you create the function, you attach the signals to it using the signal function
- `signal

```c
static void sighandler(int signo){
  if(signo == SIGINT){
    printf("");
  }
  if(signo == SIGSTOP){
    printf("");
  }
}

int main(){
  signal(SIGINT,
}
